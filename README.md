#  Useless Website 

Welcome to the **Useless Website Bundle** — a playful and humorous collection of interactive micro-features designed to do absolutely nothing productive.

Whether you're questioning the cleanliness of your screen, seeking validation for your imaginary hat, or trying to determine whether that picture is a noodle or a snake — this project is here to help (or not).

##  Purpose

This project is a light-hearted front-end collection for practicing:
- DOM manipulation
- Basic JavaScript logic
- Responsive design
- UI/UX experimentation
- Just-for-fun creative coding

##  Features

Each version builds on the last, incrementally adding more absurd utilities:

### **Is My Screen Clean?** 
Randomly tells you if your screen is clean or not. Adds an un-removable dot to the screen if it says the screen is dirty. 

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (vanilla)


## How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open any `vX_useless_website.html` file in your browser.
