#  Useless Website Bundle

Welcome to the **Useless Website Bundle** — a playful and humorous collection of interactive micro-features designed to do absolutely nothing productive.

Whether you're questioning the cleanliness of your screen, seeking validation for your imaginary hat, or trying to determine whether that picture is a noodle or a snake — this project is here to help (or not).

##  Purpose

This project is a light-hearted front-end collection for practicing:
- DOM manipulation
- Basic JavaScript logic
- Responsive design
- UI/UX experimentation
- Just-for-fun creative coding

##  Features

Each version builds on the last, incrementally adding more absurd utilities:

### **Is My Screen Clean?** 
Randomly tells you if your screen is clean or not. Adds an un-removable dot to the screen if it says the screen is dirty. 

### **Compliment my hat** 
Provides random compliments about your imaginary hat. However, it will occasionally insult your hat.

### *Chicken Soundboard** 
Play a variety of chicken cluck sounds from opera clucks to zombie clucks via pop-up alerts. 

### **Daily Obvious Fact** 
Uncover enlightening facts like "Water is wet" and "You are on a website." Updated with each button click.

### **Melt the Cheese** 
A block of cheese slowly melts with each button click.

### **Is the Door Open?**
 A philosophical (or sarcastic) answer generator about a door's status.

### **Noodle or Snake?**  
A whimsical decision between a noodle or a snake.
